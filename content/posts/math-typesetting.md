summary: Learn to Take Care Guinea Pig Properly
---

Taking care of a pet guinea pig involves providing them with a proper diet, a clean and comfortable living space, and regular social interaction. Here’s how you can ensure your guinea pig stays happy and healthy:

### 1. **Housing and Environment**
   - **Cage Size**: Guinea pigs need a large cage to roam around in. The minimum size should be 7.5 square feet for one guinea pig, and larger is always better. For multiple guinea pigs, provide more space.
   - **Bedding**: Use soft, absorbent bedding such as paper-based bedding or aspen shavings. Avoid cedar or pine wood shavings, as they can be harmful to guinea pigs. Clean the bedding frequently to prevent odor and bacteria buildup.
   - **Cage Accessories**: Provide a hideout or small shelter for your guinea pig where it can retreat to feel safe. You can also include chew toys, tunnels, and a water bottle.
   - **Temperature**: Keep your guinea pig's environment at a stable temperature, ideally between 65°F and 75°F (18°C–24°C). Avoid placing them in areas with drafts or direct sunlight.

### 2. **Diet and Nutrition**
   - **Hay**: Guinea pigs need unlimited access to fresh hay (preferably Timothy hay) for their digestive health and dental care. Hay should make up about 80% of their diet.
   - **Fresh Vegetables**: Provide fresh, leafy greens like romaine lettuce, cilantro, parsley, and dandelion greens. Avoid iceberg lettuce, as it offers little nutritional value.
   - **Pellets**: High-quality guinea pig pellets should be offered in moderation. These pellets should be high in fiber and free from seeds or dried fruits.
   - **Vitamin C**: Guinea pigs cannot produce vitamin C, so it's important to provide them with fresh vegetables rich in vitamin C, like bell peppers and kale, or a vitamin C supplement.
   - **Water**: Always ensure your guinea pig has access to fresh water. A hanging water bottle or a shallow bowl can work, but make sure it's changed regularly.

### 3. **Socialization and Interaction**
   - **Companionship**: Guinea pigs are social creatures and thrive in pairs or small groups. It’s a good idea to keep at least two guinea pigs together to prevent loneliness and promote mental stimulation.
   - **Handling**: Gently handle your guinea pig to build trust. Support their body and legs when lifting them, as they have fragile bones. Guinea pigs enjoy being pet, especially around their heads and backs.
   - **Playtime**: Allow your guinea pig to have supervised time outside of their cage in a safe, enclosed area. They enjoy exploring and chewing on safe, non-toxic objects.

### 4. **Exercise and Mental Stimulation**
   - **Out-of-Cage Time**: Give your guinea pig regular time outside their cage in a safe, enclosed area. Set up tunnels, ramps, or hideaways to encourage exploration and exercise.
   - **Toys and Enrichment**: Guinea pigs love chewing, so provide safe chew toys made from wood, cardboard, or hay. You can also provide tunnels and other interactive toys to stimulate their minds.

### 5. **Grooming**
   - **Brushing**: Guinea pigs need regular grooming, especially long-haired breeds. Brush them at least once a week to prevent tangles, mats, and shedding.
   - **Nail Trimming**: Regularly trim your guinea pig's nails to prevent them from becoming too long. Be careful not to cut into the quick, the sensitive part of the nail.
   - **Bathing**: Guinea pigs don’t need frequent baths, but if they become dirty or have greasy fur, you can give them a bath with guinea pig-safe shampoo. Always dry them thoroughly afterward to prevent chilling.

### 6. **Health Care**
   - **Regular Vet Visits**: Guinea pigs should see a vet at least once a year for a check-up. Make sure the vet is experienced with exotic pets.
   - **Signs of Illness**: Keep an eye out for signs of illness such as loss of appetite, lethargy, nasal discharge, diarrhea, or excessive scratching. Guinea pigs can hide illnesses, so it’s important to monitor their behavior closely.
   - **Dental Care**: Guinea pigs’ teeth grow continuously, so they need plenty of hay and chew toys to help wear them down. Check their teeth regularly for overgrowth or other issues.

### 7. **Hygiene**
   - **Litter Training**: Guinea pigs can be litter trained. Place a litter box in a corner of the cage where they tend to go. Use paper-based or other safe bedding in the litter box.
   - **Cage Cleaning**: Clean the cage weekly by replacing the bedding and wiping down surfaces. Regularly clean water bottles and food dishes to avoid bacteria buildup.

### 8. **Temperature and Comfort**
   - **Avoid Heat**: Guinea pigs are sensitive to heat. Never leave them in a hot car or in direct sunlight. Ensure their environment stays cool and comfortable.
   - **Comfortable Sleeping Area**: Provide a cozy space for your guinea pig to rest. A small house or hideaway within the cage can provide a secure spot for sleeping.

By ensuring your guinea pig has a proper living environment, a nutritious diet, regular exercise, and attention to their health, you can help them live a long and happy life. Guinea pigs typically live for 4-6 years, but with great care, they can live even longer.

In this example we will be using [KaTeX](https://katex.org/)

-   Create a partial under `/layouts/partials/math.html`
-   Within this partial reference the [Auto-render Extension](https://katex.org/docs/autorender.html) or host these scripts locally.
-   Include the partial in your templates ([`extend_head.html`](../papermod/papermod-faq/#custom-head--footer)) like so:
-   refer [ISSUE #236](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/issues/236)

```bash
{{ if or .Params.math .Site.Params.math }}
{{ partial "math.html" . }}
{{ end }}
```

-   To enable KaTex globally set the parameter `math` to `true` in a project's configuration
-   To enable KaTex on a per page basis include the parameter `math: true` in content files

**Note:** Use the online reference of [Supported TeX Functions](https://katex.org/docs/supported.html)
