summary: Learn to Take Care Hamster Properly
---

Taking care of a pet hamster requires attention to their specific needs in terms of habitat, diet, and daily care. Hereâ€™s a guide on how to properly care for your hamster:

### 1. **Housing**
   - **Cage Size**: Choose a cage that is at least 360 square inches of floor space for a single hamster. The larger, the better for their well-being. A plastic or glass tank with a secure mesh lid or a wire cage is suitable.
   - **Bedding**: Use soft, absorbent bedding (like paper-based bedding or aspen wood shavings) to line the bottom of the cage. Avoid cedar or pine bedding, as they can be harmful to hamstersâ€™ respiratory systems.
   - **Exercise Wheel**: Hamsters are very active and need an exercise wheel to help burn off energy. Make sure the wheel is the right size (large enough for your hamster to run comfortably without arching its back).
   - **Hideout**: Provide a small hideaway or nesting area where your hamster can sleep and feel safe. This can be a small cardboard box, a tunnel, or a plastic house.
   - **Ventilation**: Ensure the cage has proper ventilation to prevent moisture buildup and ensure fresh air.

### 2. **Diet and Nutrition**
   - **Pellets**: Provide high-quality hamster pellets as the base of their diet. Avoid mixes with seeds, as they may lead to selective eating.
   - **Fresh Vegetables**: Offer fresh vegetables like carrots, cucumber, lettuce (avoid iceberg), and spinach. These should be given in moderation.
   - **Fresh Water**: Always provide fresh, clean water in a water bottle with a metal sipper tube. Change the water daily to keep it clean.
   - **Treats**: Hamsters love occasional treats like small pieces of fruit (apple, banana) or seeds, but be careful not to overfeed them, as too much sugar can lead to obesity.
   - **Avoid Toxic Foods**: Never feed hamsters chocolate, onions, garlic, citrus, or sugary processed foods, as they are toxic to them.

### 3. **Exercise and Enrichment**
   - **Exercise Wheel**: As mentioned earlier, hamsters need a wheel for regular exercise. Ensure it is solid and not mesh to prevent foot injury.
   - **Tunnels and Toys**: Hamsters love exploring, so provide tunnels, ramps, and chew toys made of safe materials (like cardboard or untreated wood). These help stimulate their curiosity and keep them active.
   - **Playtime Outside the Cage**: Allow your hamster to have supervised playtime outside the cage in a safe, enclosed space. Ensure there are no dangerous or small objects they can chew on.

### 4. **Handling and Socialization**
   - **Gentle Handling**: Hamsters are nocturnal, so they may be more active in the evening or early morning. Handle them gently, supporting their entire body, and avoid sudden movements that could startle them.
   - **Avoid Overhandling**: While hamsters enjoy interaction, they can be easily stressed if handled too much. Keep handling sessions short and calm to build trust.
   - **Social Species**: Syrian hamsters are solitary and should be housed alone, while dwarf hamster species (like Roborovski or Campbellâ€™s) can sometimes live together, but they need to be monitored for aggression.

### 5. **Grooming**
   - **Brushing**: Hamsters generally groom themselves, but long-haired breeds like the Syrian hamster may need regular brushing to prevent their fur from matting. Brush with a soft, small comb.
   - **Nail Trimming**: Check your hamster's nails regularly and trim them if they become too long. Be cautious and use proper small-animal nail clippers to avoid cutting too close to the quick.
   - **Bedding Change**: Clean the bedding weekly, and spot clean soiled areas daily. Use mild, pet-safe cleaners for the cage, and rinse it thoroughly before adding fresh bedding.

### 6. **Health Care**
   - **Watch for Illness**: Hamsters are generally hardy but can suffer from respiratory issues, skin problems, or obesity if not cared for properly. Watch for signs like lethargy, loss of appetite, runny nose, or excessive scratching.
   - **Regular Vet Visits**: Although hamsters generally donâ€™t need routine vet visits, itâ€™s important to take them to a vet with experience in small animals if you notice any health issues.
   - **Signs of Illness**: If your hamster seems lethargic, has diarrhea, or shows any other changes in behavior, consult a vet promptly.

### 7. **Cleaning and Hygiene**
   - **Daily Spot Cleaning**: Clean out any soiled bedding, uneaten food, and droppings daily. This helps maintain hygiene and keeps odors down.
   - **Full Cage Cleaning**: Once a week, remove all bedding and clean the cage thoroughly with warm water and mild soap. Rinse well before adding fresh bedding and food.

### 8. **Temperature and Comfort**
   - **Temperature**: Hamsters do best in temperatures between 65Â°F and 75Â°F (18Â°Câ€“24Â°C). Avoid placing them in areas that are too hot or too cold.
   - **Nighttime Rest**: Hamsters are nocturnal, so they tend to sleep during the day and are active at night. Make sure they have a quiet, dark place to sleep during the day.

By providing a clean, safe, and stimulating environment, along with proper nutrition and regular socialization, your hamster can enjoy a healthy, happy life. Most hamsters live around 2-3 years, but with the right care, they can live longer.

Emoji can be enabled in a Hugo project in a number of ways.

<!--more

The [`emojify`](https://gohugo.io/functions/emojify/) function can be called directly in templates or [Inline Shortcodes](https://gohugo.io/templates/shortcode-templates/#inline-shortcodes).

To enable emoji globally, set `enableEmoji` to `true` in your site's [configuration](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration/) and then you can type emoji shorthand codes directly in content files; e.g.

<p><span class="nowrap"><span class="emojify">ðŸ™ˆ</span> <code>:see_no_evil:</code></span>  <span class="nowrap"><span class="emojify">ðŸ™‰</span> <code>:hear_no_evil:</code></span>  <span class="nowrap"><span class="emojify">ðŸ™Š</span> <code>:speak_no_evil:</code></span></p>

The [Emoji cheat sheet](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/) is a useful reference for emoji shorthand codes.

**N.B.** The above steps enable Unicode Standard emoji characters and sequences in Hugo, however the rendering of these glyphs depends on the browser and the platform. To style the emoji you can either use a third party emoji font or a font stack; e.g.

{{< highlight html >}}
.emoji {
font-family: Apple Color Emoji, Segoe UI Emoji, NotoColorEmoji, Segoe UI Symbol, Android Emoji, EmojiSymbols;
}
{{< /highlight >}}

{{< css.inline >}}

<style>
.emojify {
	font-family: Apple Color Emoji, Segoe UI Emoji, NotoColorEmoji, Segoe UI Symbol, Android Emoji, EmojiSymbols;
	font-size: 2rem;
	vertical-align: middle;
}
@media screen and (max-width:650px) {
  .nowrap {
    display: block;
    margin: 25px 0;
  }
}
</style>
