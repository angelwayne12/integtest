summary: Learn to Take Care Rabbits Properly
---

Taking care of a pet rabbit requires attention to their physical, emotional, and environmental needs. Here are some key aspects of rabbit care:

### 1. **Housing**
   - **Cage or Hutch**: Rabbits need a spacious cage or hutch. The minimum size should allow them to move around freely, stretch out, and stand upright. A larger playpen or room where they can roam is even better.
   - **Bedding**: Use safe bedding like hay, straw, or paper-based bedding (avoid cedar or pine wood shavings, as they can be harmful). Keep the cage clean and change bedding regularly.
   - **Litter box**: Rabbits can be litter trained. Place a litter box in the corner of their cage or play area and use rabbit-safe litter (avoid clumping cat litter, which can be harmful if ingested).

### 2. **Diet and Nutrition**
   - **Hay**: Rabbits need unlimited access to fresh hay (such as timothy hay) to help with digestion and to wear down their teeth.
   - **Fresh vegetables**: Provide fresh leafy greens like lettuce (avoid iceberg lettuce), spinach, parsley, cilantro, and dandelion greens. Introduce new veggies gradually.
   - **Pellets**: High-quality rabbit pellets can be offered, but in moderation (roughly 1/4 cup per 5 lbs of body weight per day).
   - **Water**: Always provide fresh water, either in a water bowl or a bottle.

### 3. **Exercise and Mental Stimulation**
   - **Space to roam**: Rabbits need daily exercise outside of their cage. Create a safe, bunny-proofed area for them to explore and hop around.
   - **Toys and Enrichment**: Provide chew toys (like wooden blocks or cardboard) to help with dental health. You can also use tunnels, balls, or treat puzzles to stimulate their minds.

### 4. **Grooming**
   - **Brushing**: Rabbits need regular brushing, especially long-haired breeds. Brushing helps prevent matting and hairballs, and it also reduces shedding. 
   - **Nail trimming**: Trim your rabbit's nails every few weeks to prevent them from getting too long. Be careful not to cut too close to the quick.
   - **Ear cleaning**: Check and clean their ears occasionally to prevent buildup of wax or debris.

### 5. **Health Care**
   - **Regular vet visits**: Rabbits should see a vet with experience in exotic pets for regular check-ups. They need annual vaccinations (depending on your location) and dental checks.
   - **Teeth care**: Rabbit teeth grow continuously, so providing hay, chew toys, and safe wooden items helps keep their teeth healthy and prevents overgrowth.
   - **Signs of illness**: Watch for signs like a decrease in appetite, lethargy, abnormal droppings, or changes in behavior, as these can indicate health issues. Rabbits are very good at hiding illness, so be vigilant.

### 6. **Socialization**
   - **Companionship**: Rabbits are social animals and thrive in pairs or groups. If you don’t have time to interact with your rabbit frequently, consider getting a companion rabbit. Ensure they are spayed/neutered if you choose this option.
   - **Handling**: Rabbits are sensitive to how they’re handled. Always lift them gently by supporting their body, especially their back and hind legs, as they are prone to back injuries.

### 7. **Bunny-Proofing**
   - **Safety**: Rabbits love to chew, so ensure that your home is rabbit-proofed. Keep electrical cords, houseplants, and other hazards out of their reach.

By providing a safe, stimulating environment, proper diet, and regular health care, you can help your pet rabbit live a happy and healthy life.
